Dear Mayor Cooper,

I am writing in regards to your recently-released plan to re-open businesses in Nashville. First and foremost, I'd like to congratulate you on this plan. It's a difficult situation that we've found ourselves in, one where every decision comes with immense downsides. The plan you've laid out is decisive yet measured – a difficult line to tread.

My concern is primarily with the two-week intervals between plan phases. Presumably these intervals were included to allow us to observe the efficacy of each policy change before further relaxing restrictions. However, two weeks is _not at all sufficient_ to make that observation. In the average case, the minimum time from infection to get confirmation of a case is 10 days (5 days of delayed symptoms(†) + 5 days to get results(††)). This means by day 14 we'll have little more than _half_ of the data for people infected on days 1-4 of the policy change.

On the other hand, in the _worst_ case, the delay is closer to 21 days (14 days of delayed symptoms + 7 days to get results). This means that, in order to get _all_ of the infections that occurred on _first_ day of the policy change, we need to wait close to _three_ weeks.

I'm not suggesting that we must wait five weeks between phases in order to collect two complete weeks' worth of data. That would be economically irresponsible.

Rather, I would like to urge you to wait closer to three weeks between policy changes. This will give us well over half of the data for the first full week of the policy change, which is enough to give us a good idea of the impact of each change.

I appreciate your consideration in this matter and look forward to any questions you may have or any clarifying details you may be able to offer.

Sincerely,

Timothy Pote
